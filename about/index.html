	<p><span class="stronger">KAITLYN CRAWFORD</span> grew up a farmer’s daughter in Uvalde,Texas, so it’s in her blood to wake up early, work hard, and not fear a little dirt. Much of her early life was spent racing her brother through corn fields, catching bugs for her entomology club, or swimming beneath the cypress trees of the Frio River.</p>

<p>Though raised in the country, Kaitlyn knew from an early age that she was a city girl at heart. She studied English and American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, spending time learning in Lyon, France and at Oxford. Her inexhaustible curiosity made choosing a major difficult (she’s read UT’s entire undergraduate catalog), but it also means she fights boredom by learning new things. She has always had an interest in writing, and has spent much of the past year learning about design. Inspired by her grandmother, she’s currently learning to make her own clothes. <p>

<p><strong>A few people who inspire her:</strong> Cindy Sherman, Susan Sontag, David Lynch and Elaine Benes.<p>
